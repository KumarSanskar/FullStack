    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: x-large">
      Full-stack development refers to the development of both front end and
      back end portions of an application. This web development process involves
      all three-layer- Presentation layer (front end part that deals with the
      user interface), Business Logic Layer (back end part that deals with data
      validation) and the Database Layer. It takes care of all the steps from
      the conception of an idea to the actual finished product.
      <br />
      Having a specialist work on each of the different subsystems of the web
      development process proves quite complex and expensive. Companies are
      demanding full stack developers who are proficient in working across
      multiple stacks.
