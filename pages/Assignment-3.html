      In this assignment we were given a task to make our webpage live by using
      Github Pages, so after creating files and comitting all of them we pushed
      it on Github and then made it live by using the Github Pages option
      available in settings of the repository.

      features. It provides access control and several collaboration features
      such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous
      integration and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it
      has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. It was commonly used to
      host open-source projects. As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over
      40 million users and more than 190 million repositories (including at
