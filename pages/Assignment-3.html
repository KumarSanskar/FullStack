    <h2>What is Git:</h2>

      Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for
      coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code
      during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and
      support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel
      branches running on different systems). Git was created by Linus Torvalds
      in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers
      contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been
      the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control
      systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on
      every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
      version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central
      server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General
      Public License Version 2.

      GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development
      and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control
      and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own
      features. It provides access control and several collaboration features
      such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous
      integration and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it
      has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. It was commonly used to
      host open-source projects. As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over
      40 million users and more than 190 million repositories (including at
      least 28 million public repositories). It is the largest source code host
      as of April 2020.

      In this assignment we were given a task to make our webpage live by using
      Github Pages, so after creating files and comitting all of them we pushed
      it on Github and then made it live by using the Github Pages option
      available in settings of the repository.
