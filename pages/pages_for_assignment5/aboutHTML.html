      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used
      language to write Web Pages.HTML was originally developed by Tim
      Berners-Lee in 1990. He is also known as the father of the web. In 1996,
      the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) became the authority to maintain the
      HTML specifications. HTML also became an international standard (ISO) in
      2000. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. HTML5 provides a faster and
      more robust approach to web development.
