      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page
      behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
      browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the
      user's device.JavaScript engines were originally used only in web
      browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most
      notably servers and a variety of applications.
