      <b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to
      specify the overall appearance of webpages as well as the appearance and
      structure of the text and elements such as images and buttons on webpages
      and their layout.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
      and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can
      improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file
      which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well
      as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
